# ``SwiftlyKodiAPI``

A Swift package to access Kodi's JSON-RPC API.

## Overview

*JSON-RPC is a HTTP- and/or raw TCP socket-based interface for communicating with [Kodi](https://kodi.tv).*

This is a framework with a Swift Class that provides structs and functions for easy use of this interface.

It supports version 12 of the interface and that is the stable version of Kodi's JSON-RPC API and is published with the release of v19 (Matrix).

## Limitations

It is currently very much work in progress....

I'm using this package in a few of my projects:

- [Kodio](https://github.com/Desbeers/Kodio): an macOS and iPad music remote application
- [Komodio](https://github.com/Desbeers/Komodio): an Apple TV Video Client

## Documentation

This package is pretty well documented with DocC.

In Xcode: `Product->Build Documentation`.
